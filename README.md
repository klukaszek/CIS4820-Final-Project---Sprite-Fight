# CIS4820 Final Project - Sprite Fight

**I received a 100% on this project and finished CIS4820 with a final grade of 100% which I am very proud of.**

I plan on continuing to explore Unity to explore realtime rendering applications since this is what I am currently interested in.

The next thing I plan on learning is proceduralism in Unity or maybe implementing a ray marcher to compare the Unity Rendering Pipeline to my own Ray Marcher.

1. Open Sprite Fight folder in Unity and let it install the Library folder.
2. Locate Assets->Scenes Folder
